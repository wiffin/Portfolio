            <h3>A little about me...</h3>
            <p>I live in the Niagara Reigon, 22 years old. I've been working straight out of highschool,
                spent most of that working at BulkBarn. 
                <br /> While I do love working with candy all day it wasn't 
                much of a challenge. 
                <br />
                That's why I decided to take a coding corse! To push myself and learn things that once seemed 
                impossible. 
                 I've had fun so far too! <br /> finally understanding something you've been stuck on is 
                very rewarding, and boy are there a lot of those.
                <br />
                I spend my free time like most 22 year olds; hang out with friends, watch tv, play videogames.
                 I've been playing minecraft since <br /> I was 12 so I think it would be cool to get to the point in 
                coding where I'd be able to understand 
                 the backend of that game, <br /> and maybe even make my own mod!
